# 0x01-NoSQL

The latest Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is not yet supported. Docker Desktop will fail to start. Due to a change in how the latest Ubuntu release restricts the unprivileged namespaces, sudo sysctl -w kernel. `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` needs to be run at least once. Refer to the Ubuntu Blog for more details.
